This repo contains material used to teach [COL331/COL633](http://abhilash-jindal.com/teaching/2023-2-col-331/), the undergrad and grad OS courses at IIT Delhi.

Here, we try to build xv6 incrementally. 
Please see the branches to see xv6 versions that build towards the fuller [xv6-public](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public). 
You can diff a branch with its previous branch to see what has changed.
Each branch also has a <branchname>.md file to describe what is new in that branch.
